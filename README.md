# Machine-Learning-Resources

Machine learning is the application of Artificial Intelligence where a predictive model learns identifying pattern from the data. 
I have prepared a set of articles with practical demonstration on how you can learn Machine Learning and build your own predictive models. 
All of these articles are published in Analytics India Magazine and Analytics Steps website.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the journey of Data science, I feel its the transformation of Data that can help you to attain good results. The data cannot be directly fed to a predictive model and it's very important to pre-process it. Real experience in analytics can come by understanding your data well and the problem that is to be solved.

Do keep this thing in mind- "Garbage In Garbage Out". The below articles will help you to understand more about your data and how to preprocess it in an good manner. The article will help you undetstand more about data anlysis.

### Machine Learning Algorithms 

Now when we are done with our data preprocessing now its time to build the predictive model. 
In machine learning we have several different algorithm to build classification as well as regression models. We need to pick that algorithm that works well for our data.
Refer to the below articles that will take you to every other machine learning algorithm.

### Model Performance - Hyperparameter Tuning and Error Metrics in Machine Learning

After we are done building the model we now need to tune the hyperparameter to attain more good results. These hyperparameter are responsible for controlling the power of a machine learning algorithm.
The below article will cover more about model parameters, hyperparameter tuning methods and also how to check the model performance using different error metrics.

### Regularization In Machine Learning 

Regularization is a method that is used to prevent overfitting in machine learning model. This means when the model performs very good in the training but poorly on unseen data.
Then we make use of regularization to prevent that. Check the implementation Ridge and Lasso Regression that is widely used regularization technique in machine learning.

### Machine Learning Model Deployment

Once we are done with building models, evaluating the performance and all set to go for unseen data prediction. Now its time to check the real potential of the model by deploying it in real time. Check the below article where I have explained about Deploying a machine learning model using Flask.

### Projects 

1) In this project we have to build a Classification model that will be able to classify patients as abnormal and normal from the biomechanical features.

2) This Project involved using classification algorithms and ensemble techniques to diagnose Parkinson’s Disease (PD) using the patient voice recording data. Various models were used including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc. and comparison of accuracy across these models was done to finalize the model for prediction
