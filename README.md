# Machine-Learning-Resources

Machine learning is the application of Artificial Intelligence where a predictive model learns identifying pattern from the data. 
I have prepared a set of articles with practical demonstration on how you can learn Machine Learning and build your own predictive models. 
All of these articles are published in Analytics India Magazine and Analytics Steps website.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the journey of Data science, I feel its the transformation of Data that can help you to attain good results. The data cannot be directly fed to a predictive model and it's very important to pre-process it. Real experience in analytics can come by understanding your data well and the problem that is to be solved.

Do keep this thing in mind- "Garbage In Garbage Out". The below articles will help you to understand more about your data and how to preprocess it in an good manner. The article will help you undetstand more about data analysis.

### Machine Learning Algorithms 

Now once we are done with preparing our data now its time to build the predictive model. 
In machine learning we have several different algorithm to build classification as well as regression models. We need to pick that algorithm that works well for our data.
Refer to the below articles that will help you to understand different machine learning algorithms that can be used to build models.

### Model Performance and Evaluation Metrics

After we build our model now its time to check the actual power of the model. We can check this using different evulation metrics like accuracy score, confusion matrix, etc. Also, if we want to test how will the model perform on unseen data we make use of techniques like Cross Validation and Boot Strap Sampling. This gives us an idea how will the model perform on production data.

### Hyperparameter Tuning 

In machine learning we always define two things one is parameter and other is hyperparamter. The paramter is internal to the model like coefficients in Logistic Regression whereas Hyperparameter are the ones that control the power of an algorithm or an model for example defining k in KNN algorithm is an example of hyperparamter. 
Check the below articles where you can learn how to tune the model hyperparameter and get the best performance of the machine learning model.

[2) Guide To Hyperparameters Tuning Using GridSearchCV And RandomizedSearchCV](https://analyticsindiamag.com/guide-to-hyperparameters-tuning-using-gridsearchcv-and-randomizedsearchcv/)


### Regularization In Machine Learning 

Regularization is a method that is used to prevent overfitting in machine learning model. This means when the model performs very good in the training but poorly on unseen data.
Then we make use of regularization to prevent that. Check the implementation Ridge and Lasso Regression that is widely used regularization technique in machine learning.

### Machine Learning Model Deployment

Once we are done with building models, evaluating the performance and all set to go for unseen data prediction. Now its time to check the real potential of the model by deploying it in real time. Check the below article where I have explained about Deploying a machine learning model using Flask.

### Projects 

1) In this project we have to build a Classification model that will be able to classify patients as abnormal and normal from the biomechanical features.
